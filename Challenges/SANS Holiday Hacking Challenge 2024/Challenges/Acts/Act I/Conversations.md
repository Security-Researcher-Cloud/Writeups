| [Alabaster Snowball (The Front Yard (Act 1))](https://2024.holidayhackchallenge.com/badge?section=conversation&id=alabastersnowball)<br>![alabastersnowball.png](../../../Assets/images/npc/alabastersnowball.png) | Well hello, I'm Alabaster Snowball!<br><br>As you can see all around you, we're still unpacking from our return from the Geese Islands.<br><br>Strangely, Santa is still nowhere to be found. When we couldn't find him on Christmas Island, we thought he must already be here in the North Pole, but nope.<br><br>Even though he's not here, I know he'd still want us to start preparing for the holiday present deliveries, so that's what we're gonna do!<br><br>With all our equipment all jumbled up in boxes, we've been experimenting with ways of securely storing the lists related to our gift-giving operations. We tried implementing the Naughty-Nice List using Blockchain back in 2022 but Jack Frost hacked it and we are trying to find a suitable technical approach for securely storing it. Integrity is of critical importance.<br><br>Without them, naughty listers may get all the good presents, and those that have been nice may get coal. Can you imagine? The horror! This isn't Halloween!<br><br>I've asked my fellow elves to help out with this, since I'm not the most tech-savvy of the bunch. Many got right to it, but some are being quite ho-hum about it. That seems a little strange to me, but maybe they're just tired from the journey home.<br><br>I may not be the sharpest tool in the repository when it comes to the technical stuff, but it seems I'm quite the galvanizer!<br><br>Anywho, why not join Bow for a game of cURL? And then go help Morcel and Jewel with securing the Wish List, please. Thanks a bunch!<br><br>cURL-ing sure is fun huh! I bet you made Bow's day by playing with him. Everyone over here was too busy, and everyone on Wombley's side just refused to play. I wonder what's gotten into them.<br><br>I think UART awesome! See what I did there? Keep on testing the security of the current Wish List storage.<br><br>Well, seems like that may not be the best way to store the list. Back to brainstorming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Bow Ninecandle (The Front Yard (Act 1))](https://2024.holidayhackchallenge.com/badge?section=conversation&id=bowninecandle)<br>![bowninecandle.png](../../../Assets/images/npc/bowninecandle.png)                 | Well hello there! I'm Bow Ninecandle, bright as a twinkling star! Everyone's busy unpacking, but I've grown quite bored of that. Care to join me for a lovely game?<br><br>Oh Joy! Today, We're diving into something delightful: the curling challenge—without any ice, but plenty of sparkle!<br><br>No icy brooms here though! We're all about Curl, sending web requests from the command line like magic messages.<br><br>So, have you ever wielded Curl before? If not, no worries at all, my friend!<br><br>It's this clever little tool that lets you whisper directly to web servers. Pretty neat, right?<br><br>Think of it like sending secret scrolls through the interwebs, awaiting a wise reply!<br><br>To begin, you can type something like curl [https://example.com](https://example.com/). Voilà! The HTML of the page appears, like conjuring a spell!<br><br>Simple enough, huh? But oh, there's a whole world of magic you can cast with Curl!<br><br>We're just brushing the surface here, but trust me—it’s a hoot and a half!<br><br>If you get tangled up or need help, just give me a shout! I’m here to help you ace this curling spectacle.<br><br>So, are you ready to curl those web requests like a pro? Let’s see your magic unfold!<br><br>Bravo! Look at you, curling through that like a true web wizard!<br><br>You zipped through that challenge faster than a curling stone on enchanted ice!<br><br>Wait... did you just slice and dice it all into three commands? My stars, you're a Curling conjurer!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Jewel Loggins (The Front Yard (Act 1))](https://2024.holidayhackchallenge.com/badge?section=conversation&id=jewelloggins)<br>![jewelloggins.png](../../../Assets/images/npc/jewelloggins.png)                     | Hello there! I’m Jewel Loggins.<br><br>I hate to trouble you, but I really need some help. Santa’s Little Helper tool isn’t working, and normally, Santa takes care of this… but with him missing, it’s all on me.<br><br>I need to connect to the UART interface to get things running, but it’s like the device just refuses to respond every time I try.<br><br>I've got all the right tools, but I must be overlooking something important. I've seen a few elves with similar setups, but everyone’s so busy preparing for Santa’s absence.<br><br>If you could guide me through the connection process, I’d be beyond grateful. It’s critical because this interface controls access to our North Pole access cards!<br><br>We used to have a note with the serial settings, but apparently, one of Wombley’s elves shredded it! You might want to check with Morcel Nougat—he might have a way to recover it.<br><br>Fantastic! You managed to connect to the UART interface—great work with those tricky wires! I couldn't figure it out myself…<br><br>Rumor has it you might be able to bypass the hardware altogether for the gold medal. Why not see if you can find that shortcut?<br><br>Next, we need to access the terminal and modify the access database. We're looking to grant access to card number **42**.<br><br>Start by using the slh application—that’s the key to getting into the access database. Problem is, the ‘slh’ tool is password-protected, so we need to find it first.<br><br>Search the terminal thoroughly; passwords sometimes get left out in the open.<br><br>Once you've found it, modify the entry for card number 42 to grant access. Sounds simple, right? Let’s get to it!<br><br>Wow! You're amazing at this! Clever move finding the password in the command history. It’s a good reminder about keeping sensitive information secure…<br><br>There’s a tougher route if you're up for the challenge to earn the Gold medal. It involves directly modifying the database and generating your own HMAC signature.<br><br>I know you can do it—come back once you've cracked it!<br><br>Brilliant work! We now have access to… the Wish List! I couldn't have done it without you—thank you so much! |

I'm so glad we set up this little break area to take a load off for a little while.<br><br>Just me, the snow, chestnuts roasting over an open fire, and a cup of milk tea. The Geese Islands were relaxing and all, but this is what I call paradise.<br><br>Bow asked me to play a round of cURLing with him, but I was just too exhausted. I'm happy someone finally joined him!<br><br>Hacking your way into that box was impressive! You're almost as good as me at finding buried treasure!<br><br>We really need to find a way to keep the Wish List and Naughty-Nice List secure. Some of the elves seem to be asking a lot of questions about them. Meh, probably nothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

I haven't found that cool pirate map that I discovered on Geese Islands yet. It must be in one of these crates somewhere.<br><br>I should just keep helping unpack, unlike the elves over there, and it'll turn up eventually.<br><br>Sure they look busy, but they're not actually helping with holiday preparations. They're just building.... I don't even know what.<br><br>What if someone mistook it for the Wish List and locked it up in a chest?! Oh I so hope not. I wouldn't be surprised with how Wombley's crew has been acting over there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It's great to see you've finally made the journey here to join us.<br><br>Erm, by that I mean all of Santa's elves, of course. The big guy's not here, so I've been coordinating holiday preparation efforts.<br><br>We're just hard at work getting things set up for... the holiday season. Present deliveries and what not.<br><br>Some of us are also busy researching the best way to keep the Wish List and Naughty-Nice List uhh.. safe.<br><br>Not to cut our conversation short, but you must be tired from your journey. You should go over to the fireplace and relax with the others that are taking a break.<br><br>We're doing very important work over here and I need to make sure we stay on schedule.<br><br>Swell idea, playing cURL with Bow. Why don't you keep doing that.<br><br>Finding a way to securely store the Wish List is going to be a challenge huh? It is vital to our operations. We cannot allow it to fall into the hands of those that want to change the holidays for the worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

I'm Morcel Nougat, dashing around like a reindeer on a sugar rush! We've got a bit of a dilemma, and I could really use your expertise.<br><br>Wombley and Alabaster have taken charge now that Santa’s gone missing, and We're scrambling to get the Wish List secured. But... one of the elves in the Data Management Team got overzealous, and the Shredder McShreddin 9000 gobbled up a crucial document we need to access Santa's chest!<br><br>It’s our golden ticket to getting Santa’s Little Helper tool working properly. Without it, the hardware hack we're planning is as empty as Santa’s sleigh in January.<br><br>Think you can help? I can get you into the Shredder McShreddin 9000’s inner workings to retrieve the pieces, but there are two access codes involved. One of the elves left a hint, but it’s all a blur to me!<br><br>I've noticed that some elves keep referring to a certain book when they walk by. I bet it has the answers we need to crack the code and recover the document!<br><br>You know, some of the elves always have their noses in the same book when they pass by here. Maybe it’s got the clues we need to crack the code?<br><br>WOW, you did it! You know, they say Ottendorf ciphers were used back in the Frosty Archives crisis… or was that during the Jack Frost incident? Either way, you're amazing!<br><br>But wait—there’s still one more code tucked away! This one might need a bit more elbow grease… you may need to try a few combinations to crack it!<br><br>Incredible work! You pieced together the code like a true sleuth and retrieved the shreds we need. I’m not quite sure how you’ll put them all together, but if anyone can, it’s you!<br><br>Your help has been absolutely essential, especially now with Santa missing. Wombley and Alabaster will want to hear all about it—go share the news with Jewel Loggins!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
