It's a somber time here in the North Pole.<br><br>Offense versus defense, red versus blue, naughty versus nice, elf versus elf. Therein lies the tragedy. We are all elves with the same goals: be merry and make the holidays a resounding success.<br><br>But Wombley doesn't see it that way. He's still upset with how Santa moved operations to the Geese Islands last year, and how Santa has, in Wombley's words, abandoned us this year. So he's trying to take over operations from Santa.<br><br>But most of us believe in Santa, and know he'll be back. We just need to hold Wombley off from getting the Naughty-Nice List until Santa returns.<br><br>And to do that, we're scraping together whatever we can with the supplies we have. I don't know where Wombley got all those resources for everything he's built, but good always triumphs in the end!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

I'm Dusty Giftwrap, back from the battlefield! I'm mostly here for the snowball fights!<br><br>But I also don't want Santa angry at us, you wouldn't like him when he's angry. His face becomes as red as his hat! So I guess I'm rooting for Alabaster.<br><br>Alabaster Snowball seems to be having quite a pickle with Wombley Cube. We need your wizardry.<br><br>Take down Wombley the usual way with a friend, or try a different strategy by tweaking client-side values for an extra edge.<br><br>Alternatively, we've got a secret weapon - a giant snow bomb - but we can't remember where we put it or how to launch it.<br><br>Adjust the right elements and victory for Alabaster can be secured with more subtlety. Intriguing, right?<br><br>Raring to go? Terrific! Here's a real brain tickler. Navigator of chaos or maestro of subtlety, which will you be? Either way, remember our objective: bring victory to Alabaster.<br><br>Confidence! Wit! We've got what it takes. Team up with a friend or find a way to go solo - no matter how, let's end this conflict and take down Wombley!<br><br>Fantastic work! You've used your hacker skills to lead Alabaster’s forces to victory. That was some impressive strategy!<br><br>Christmas is on the line! For a mischievous edge-up, dive into the game’s code - a few client-side tweaks to speed, movement, or power might shift the balance… or just help us find that secret weapon we misplaced!<br><br>Brilliant! You unravel the puzzle and launched the 'mother-of-all-snow-bombs' like a true mastermind. Wombley never saw it coming!<br><br>Excellent! With Wombley’s forces defeated, they’ll have no choice but to admit defeat and abandon their wild plans to hijack Christmas.                                                                                                                                       |

Eve Snowshoes and Team Alabaster in need of assistance.<br><br>I've been busy creating and testing a modern solution to Santa’s Naughty-Nice List, and I even built an Android app to streamline things for Alabaster’s team.<br><br>But here’s my tiny reindeer-sized problem: I made a [debug](https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2024/SantaSwipe.apk) version and a [release](https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2024/SantaSwipeSecure.aab) version of the app.<br><br>I accidentally left out a child's name on each version, but for the life of me, I can't remember who!<br><br>Could you start with the debug version first, figure out which child’s name isn’t shown in the list within the app, then we can move on to release? I’d be eternally grateful!<br><br>Aha! Success! You found it!<br><br>Thanks for staying on your toes and helping me out—every step forward keeps Alabaster’s plans on track. You're a real lifesaver!<br><br>Nice job completing the debug version—smooth as a sleigh ride on fresh snow!<br><br>But now, the real challenge lies in the obfuscated release version. Ready to dig deeper and show Alabaster’s faction your skills?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I'm terribly worried about the current affairs on the North Pole.<br><br>Who ever could have predicted there would be a civil war between us elves? There's even a DMZ, which stands for demilitarized zone, dividing us.<br><br>There's a rumor going around that some determined elf dug a secret underground tunnel network that connects both sides, and even has an exit in the DMZ.<br><br>But the entrances are... the outhouses. Gross! That's why I haven't gone exploring. I guess it's the perfect entrance for a secret tunnel though.<br><br>Right where elves do their... business. Hiding in plain sight!<br><br>I sure hope all the elves are just anxious and riled up only because Santa's not here. When he gets back, he'll have everyone happy and together again. I just know it, you'll see.<br><br>But where is he, and what is taking him so long? Oh Santa, please come home soon...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Piney Sappington here.<br><br>You've probably heard the latest—things are getting tense around here with all the faction business between Wombley and Alabaster. But, let’s focus on this PowerShell Terminal for now.<br><br>This is the remote access for our snowball weaponry. We programmed some defense mechanisms to deter intruders, but the system is in a faulty lockdown state.<br><br>I certainly wasn't the one that programmed the mechanism. Nope not me. But can you help me find a way through it so I can regain access?<br><br>There's two functions I need access to. The snow cannon terminal, which should be easier. And the snow cannon production and deployment plans. That one's better defended.<br><br>Still, I've got faith in you. We need every advantage we can get right now, and you might be just the one to tip the balance.<br><br>So, think you can do it? Are you ready to show what you've got?<br><br>Fantastic work! You've navigated PowerShell’s tricky waters and retrieved the codeword—just what we need in these uncertain times. You're proving yourself a real asset!<br><br>I'll let you in on a little secret—there’s a way to bypass the usual path and write your own PowerShell script to complete the challenge. Think you're up for it? I know you are!<br><br>Well done! you've demonstrated solid PowerShell skills and completed the challenge, giving us a bit of an edge. Your persistence and mastery are exactly what we need—keep up the great work!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Psst, over here. Hey, I'm Chimney Scissorsticks.<br><br>I'm not liking all the tension brewing between the factions, so even though I agreed with how Wombley was handling things, I get the feeling this is going to end poorly for everyone. So I'm trying to get this data to Alabaster's side. Can you help?<br><br>Wombley's planning something BIG in that toy factory. He's not really making toys in there. He's building an armada of drones!<br><br>They're packed with valuable data from the elves working on the project. I think they hide the admin password in the drone flight logs. We need to crack this to prevent this escalating snowball showdown.<br><br>You'll be working with KML files, tracking drone flight paths. Intriguing, right? We need every detail to prepare for what’s ahead!<br><br>Use tools like Google Earth and some Python scripting to decode the hidden passwords and codewords locked in those files.<br><br>Ready to give it a go? It’s going to be a wild ride, and your skills might just turn the tide of this conflict!<br><br>Bravo! You've tackled the drone challenge and navigated through those KML files like a true expert. Your skills are just what we need to prevent the big snowball battle—the North Pole thanks you!<br><br>Well done! You cracked the code from the drones and showed you've mastered the basics of KML files. This kind of expertise will be invaluable as we gear up for what’s ahead!<br><br>But I need you to dig deeper. Make sure you’re checking those file structures carefully, and remember—rumor has it there is some injection flaw that might just give you the upper hand. Keep your eyes sharp!<br><br>Absolutely fantastic! I think you found the most difficult path in, from file carving to SQL injection. Not many can do that, but you've shown you’re ready for anything the factions throw your way! |

We at Team Wombley pulled off some nasty stuff.<br><br>Phishing attacks, ransomware, and cyber espionage, oh yeah!<br><br>We pulled loads of all-nighters to make it all happen. Energy drinks rock!<br><br>Our teams did what Alabaster said we never could and breached Santa's network. We're so rad.<br><br>It would take a master defender to fix all the damage we caused. But defense is so lame! Offense is where it's at.<br><br>You should just leave them to panic and join our side.
