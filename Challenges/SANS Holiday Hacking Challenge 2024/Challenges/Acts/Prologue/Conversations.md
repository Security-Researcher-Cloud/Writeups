| [Jingle Ringford (Frosty's Beach)](https://2024.holidayhackchallenge.com/badge?section=conversation&id=jingleringford)<br>![jingleringford.png](../../../Assets/images/npc/jingleringford.png)                     | Welcome to the Geese Islands and the 2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge!<br><br>I'm Jingle Ringford, one of Santa's many elves.<br><br>...<br><br>Just kidding! It's actually the 2024 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge!<br><br>And although we're on Frosty's Beach on Christmas Island, we'll soon be on our way back to the North Pole.<br><br>I thought it best to wait here for people that heard we're on the Geese Islands but may not know we're leaving.<br><br>I haven't seen Santa since we started packing up, but he always asks me to give a quick orientation to newcomers, so I'm continuing the tradition.<br><br>Before you head out any further onto the island, you need to accomplish two simple tasks.<br><br>But first, here's a parting gift. I packed this snowball made of the magical, never-melting snow of Christmas Island. A little souvenir to take with you when we leave for the North Pole.<br><br>Click on the snowball on your avatar. That's where you will see your Objectives, Hints, resource links, and Conversations for the Holiday Hack Challenge.<br><br>Now, click on the **Cranberry Pi Terminal** and follow the on-screen instructions.<br><br>You're a natural! Something new this year you may not know is that all challenges have an easy and hard mode. There's also story mode, if you want to skip the challenges and watch how our holiday season's adventure unfolds!<br><br>Your snowball will reflect how you've solved the challenges with the bronze, silver, and gold trophies.<br><br>Well, that's it, now you're orientated! Feel free to get yourself settled in, establish a cohort with others, or just explore this lovely island. Just be careful where you walk as we are moving around some pretty heavy crates.<br><br>Oh, while we're preparing everything to set sail for the North Pole, I heard Poinsettia McMittens and Angel Candysalt could use some assistance. I'm sure they'll appreciate any help you can provide!<br><br>We'll let you know when the boat leaves, but for now relax, enjoy the sun, and most importantly, have FUN!<br><br>--- |
| [Angel Candysalt (Frosty's Beach)](https://2024.holidayhackchallenge.com/badge?section=conversation&id=angelcandysalt)<br>![angelcandysalt.png](../../../Assets/images/npc/angelcandysalt.png)                     | Welcome back, island adventurer! I'm Angel Candysalt — so happy to finally meet you!<br><br>I'm thrilled you're here because I could really use a hand with something.<br><br>Have you ever heard of a game called Connections?<br><br>It’s simple! All you need to do is find groups of four related words.<br><br>I've been stuck on it all day, and I'm sure someone as sharp as you will breeze through it.<br><br>Oh, and while you're at it, check out randomElf's score — they hit fifty thousand points, which seems… oddly suspicious.<br><br>Think they might have tampered with the game? Just a hunch!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Poinsettia McMittens (Frosty's Beach)](https://2024.holidayhackchallenge.com/badge?section=conversation&id=poinsettiamcmittens)<br>![poinsettiamcmittens.png](../../../Assets/images/npc/poinsettiamcmittens.png) | Center your mind, and become one with the island!<br><br>Relax...<br><br>This isn't working! I'm trying to play this game but the whole "moving back to the North Pole" thing completely threw me off.<br><br>Say, how about you give it a try. It's really simple. All you need to do is help the elf get to the exit.<br><br>The faster you get there, the better your score!<br><br>I've run into some weirdness with the springs though. If I had created this game it would've been a lot more stable, but I won't **comment** on that any further.<br><br>The rest of these elves are like corporate zombos. They just run around in circles unless you give them some direction.<br><br>Way to pass them some of your super centered energy. Better you than me, though. I'd let them walk themselves straight off the island.<br><br>You took the easy win, it seems we're kindred spirits. But there's also a hard way to solve this challenge.<br><br>The more segments you use, the higher the reward. But who actually wants life to be more difficult?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
